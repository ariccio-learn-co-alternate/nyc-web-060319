## Sinatra Forms and Associations

Parking Lot:

- Process/Sequence of events
  - Building out an application
- Reading the errors
- Clarifying convention vs convention
  - What's mandatory vs opinionated

# How do we do all the things we've been doing w/ a relationship (i.e. one to many)

# Separation of Concerns

- Specifically as it relates to controllers and views

# Complete all 7 Controller actions

- index
- show
- new -- render a "new" form
- create -- receives params with information from the browser and "creates" our instance
- edit -- render an "edit" form
- update -- receives params with information from the browser and "updates" our instance
- delete

# Goal for today:

- be able to build out our own model/controller/view for a resource/model
