# Intro to React

## Questions

- global variables
- extends Component vs extends React.Component

## Creating a React App

- npm install create-react-app -g
- create-react-app _app name_

## Why use React

- Virtual DOM
- Reusability

    Components: functions that return a React element

        Components have a lifecycle that allows us to run code at different stages of a component's "life"

        Components can receive "props" which are arguments that are passed into components that allows each component to be dynamic

- Imperative vs. Declaritive

    Imperative: explicitly write each step

    Declaritive: write want you want and let your app do the heavy lifting

        JSX: Syntactical sugar that allows us to write html inside of JS, but is still just JS and are bound by the rules of JS

## Tools of React

- Import/Export - JS
- OOJS - JS
- Lifecycle Methods - React
- Components & JSX - React
- Props - React

Tommorow
- State - React
- Callback Functions - JS
- Event Handlers - JS/React

## Goal: Build our first React App
