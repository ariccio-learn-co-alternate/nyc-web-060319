# Intro to React

## Creating a React App

- npm install create-react-app
- create-react-app _app name_

## Why use React

- Virtual DOM
- Reusability

    Components: functions that return a React element

        Components have a lifecycle that allows us to run code at different stages of a component's "life"

        Components can receive "props" which are arguments that are passed into components that allows each component to be dynamic

- Imperative vs. Declaritive

    Imperative: explicitly write each step

    Declaritive: write want you want and let your app do the heavy lifting

        JSX: Syntactical sugar that allows us to write html inside of JS, but is still just JS and are bound to the rules of JS

## Goal: Build our first React App
