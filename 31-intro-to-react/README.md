# Intro to React

## Creating a React App

- npm install create-react-app
- create-react-app _app name_

## Why use React

- Virtual DOM
- Reusability
    Components: functions that return a React element
- Imperative vs. Declaritive
    JSX: Syntactical sugar that allows us to write html inside of JS, but is still just JS

## Goal: Build our first React App
